# Face-recognition-attendance-system
A simple face detection system which recognises face using the face recognition library and then writes the name into the specified file.
The path with set of faces is given to encode the faces.As a face gets detected in the video ,distance with the existing faces is calculated and the one with minimum distance is 
given as the recognised face.In case of adding a new image ,no need of changing the existing code ,adding the image in the source path with the respective name will do the work.Do give it a try adding new images.
